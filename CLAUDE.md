# CLAUDE.md — Dishu Masala Storefront

Project constitution. Claude Code must read this file before writing any code and must not
contradict it. If a request conflicts with this file, say so and ask.

---

## 1. What we are building

A premium, light-theme, India-only (INR, English) e-commerce platform for **Dishu Food and
Beverages** (dishumasala.com) — organic Indian spices and premium herbal teas.

**Fully custom. There is no WordPress and no WooCommerce.** No PHP, no wp-json, no plugins, no
themes, no WordPress-derived data or auth. We own the storefront, the database, the admin panel,
payments, shipping, email and the customer accounts. If any instruction anywhere in this repo
mentions WordPress or WooCommerce, it is stale — delete it.

The brand's hero asset is **Blue Tea (butterfly pea flower)**, which physically changes colour from
blue to violet to magenta when lemon (acid) is added. The client's own product copy already says so:
*"Brilliant blue that transforms into purple when mixed with lemon."* That colour shift is the spine
of the visual identity. We call it the **Lemon Shift**.

### Reference quality bar
`bluetea.co.in` — its premium feel comes from restraint: cream/white space, one dominant colour,
photography-led cards, heavy trust scaffolding. We match that discipline and beat it with the one
thing they don't have: the Lemon Shift.

### What building custom means we now own
Order emails, invoices and GST presentation, refunds, inventory, coupon logic, review moderation,
customer accounts, and a **staff-facing admin panel**. The admin is not a nice-to-have — without it
the client cannot run their business. Treat it as a first-class product, not a CRUD afterthought.

## 2. Stack — fixed, do not substitute

| Layer | Choice | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | **Next.js 15+, App Router, TypeScript strict** | Server Components by default; `"use client"` only where interaction demands it. |
| Database | **Neon Postgres** | Plain Postgres. Branch per migration in dev. |
| ORM | **Drizzle ORM** + `drizzle-kit` migrations | SQL-first, typed. Migrations are checked in and never hand-edited after being applied. |
| Styling | **Tailwind CSS v4**, CSS-first `@theme` | Tokens live in CSS variables (§5). No colour literals in components. |
| UI primitives | Radix UI in a **local** `components/ui` | No heavy component library. |
| Animation | CSS transitions + `motion` for the hero only | Always respect `prefers-reduced-motion`. |
| State | **Zustand** for cart + wishlist (localStorage-persisted) | Server is always the price authority (§7.5). |
| Validation | **Zod** on every input, every route handler, every server action | |
| Forms | `react-hook-form` + Zod resolver | |
| Auth | **Auth.js v5 (NextAuth)**, credentials + Argon2id hashes, role-based sessions | One `users` table, `role` in `customer` / `staff` / `admin`. |
| File storage | **Cloudflare R2** via the S3 SDK, presigned uploads, `sharp` for derivatives | Zero egress fees. Portable to any S3 provider. |
| Email | **Resend** + **React Email** templates | All transactional mail. |
| Payments | **Razorpay** — Orders API, server-side, HMAC verified | Plus COD. |
| Logistics | **Shiprocket** — serviceability, order push, tracking | |
| Rich text | **Tiptap** in the admin, stored as JSON, rendered server-side | For blog and recipe posts. |
| Charts (admin) | `recharts` | Admin dashboard only. |
| Testing | Vitest + Playwright | |
| Deploy | **Vercel**, with `output: "standalone"` kept on | No Vercel-only APIs — must stay runnable under PM2 + Nginx. |

Node 20+. Package manager: pnpm.

**Never** introduce: PHP or anything WordPress-shaped, a second CSS framework,
styled-components, Redux, Prisma, a headless CMS, an auth SaaS, an admin-panel framework
(no Retool/Refine/AdminJS — we build it), or any paid service not listed above.

## 3. Architecture

```
                     ┌────────────────────────────────┐
Shopper ────────────►│  Next.js App Router (Vercel)   │
Staff  ──/admin─────►│  RSC + server actions + routes │
                     └────┬───────────┬───────────┬────┘
                         │           │           │
              Drizzle ────┤           │           ──── Razorpay  (orders, verify, webhook)
          Neon Postgres  │           │           ──── Shiprocket (pincode, push, track)
                         │           │           ──── Resend     (order + auth email)
                         │           ─────────────┴─── Cloudflare R2 (images)
                         ── single source of truth for catalogue, orders, content
```

Rules:

1. **Postgres is the only source of truth.** No JSON file, no external commerce API, no cache is
   authoritative. `data/catalog.json` exists solely to seed the database and to power local
   development before the DB is provisioned.
2. Data access lives **only** in `lib/db/queries/*` (reads) and `lib/db/mutations/*` (writes).
   No component, page or route handler builds a query inline. No ORM import outside `lib/db/`.
3. Server-only modules start with `import "server-only"`. No database URL, API key or secret may
   carry a `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix. Grep for leaks before every phase is called done.
4. Storefront reads are cached with `unstable_cache` / `revalidateTag` on tags `products`,
   `product:<slug>`, `collection:<slug>`, `reviews:<productId>`, `posts`. Every admin mutation that
   changes public data must call `revalidateTag` for the affected tags — a stale storefront after an
   admin edit is a bug.
5. Mutations are **server actions** for form-driven work and **route handlers** for webhooks and
   third-party callbacks. Both Zod-validate their input and return a typed result, never a raw throw
   to the client.
6. Every admin mutation writes an `audit_log` row (actor, action, entity, entity id, diff).

---

## 4. Money, tax and data integrity

- **All money is stored and computed as integer paise.** Column names end in `_paise`. Never a
  float, never a `numeric` for money, never rupee arithmetic in JavaScript. Format for display only,
  at the edge, via `lib/money.ts` (`formatINR(paise)`).
- Prices are **GST-inclusive**, matching the client's current pricing. Never add tax at checkout.
  Every price surface carries an "Inclusive of all taxes" affordance.
- `order_items` stores a **snapshot** — product name, SKU, option label, unit price, MRP — at the
  moment of purchase. Never render a historical order by joining to live product data; prices and
  names change and invoices must not.
- Order numbers are human-readable and sequential-ish (`DM-2026-00042`) from a Postgres sequence,
  never a raw UUID shown to a customer.
- Every timestamp is `timestamptz`, stored UTC, rendered in Asia/Kolkata.

---

## 5. Design system — the non-negotiable part

### 5.1 Light theme only
There is no dark mode on the storefront. Do not add one, do not add a toggle, do not write
`prefers-color-scheme: dark` rules. (The admin may use the same light palette — see §9.)

### 5.2 Tokens (`app/globals.css`, `@theme`)

```css
@theme {
  /* Ground — ivory, not white. Warmth is what reads as premium. */
  --color-bg:        #FCFAF6;
  --color-surface:   #FFFFFF;
  --color-surface-2: #F5F1EA;
  --color-line:      #E7E1D8;

  /* Ink */
  --color-ink:    #17161A;
  --color-ink-2:  #4A4750;
  --color-ink-3:  #7C7885;

  /* Lemon Shift — the brand spine. Blue brew, lemon added, magenta. */
  --color-brew-1: #123FA8;  /* deep butterfly pea */
  --color-brew-2: #2E5BE0;  /* blue              */
  --color-brew-3: #6C3FD1;  /* violet            */
  --color-brew-4: #A62D9B;  /* orchid            */
  --color-brew-5: #D62A6B;  /* magenta           */
  --color-citrus: #F3C623;  /* lemon             */

  /* Product-family accents */
  --color-hibiscus: #C0263C;  /* Red Tea       */
  --color-leaf:     #2F6B4F;  /* Classic/Assam */
  --color-turmeric: #E39A1F;
  --color-chilli:   #C43B23;
  --color-coriander:#7C8F45;
  --color-pepper:   #37342F;

  /* Semantic (admin + storefront status) — separate from the accent system */
  --color-ok:   #2F6B4F;
  --color-warn: #B7791F;
  --color-crit: #B4232E;

  /* Premium hairline — 1px rules and small caps only */
  --color-gold: #B08D3F;

  --font-display: "Fraunces", ui-serif, Georgia, serif;
  --font-sans:    "Inter", ui-sans-serif, system-ui, sans-serif;

  --radius-sm: 6px;  --radius-md: 12px;  --radius-lg: 20px;  --radius-xl: 28px;
  --shadow-card: 0 1px 2px rgb(23 22 26 / .04), 0 8px 24px -12px rgb(23 22 26 / .10);
  --shadow-lift: 0 2px 4px rgb(23 22 26 / .05), 0 18px 40px -16px rgb(23 22 26 / .18);
}

:root {
  --gradient-lemon-shift: linear-gradient(100deg,
    var(--color-brew-1) 0%, var(--color-brew-2) 20%, var(--color-brew-3) 45%,
    var(--color-brew-4) 68%, var(--color-brew-5) 86%, var(--color-citrus) 100%);
  --gradient-brew-cool: linear-gradient(135deg, var(--color-brew-1), var(--color-brew-3));
}
```

Load Fraunces (variable, 400–700, opsz) and Inter (400/500/600) via `next/font/google`,
`display: "swap"`, real fallback stacks. No other typefaces.

### 5.3 Type scale

| Role | Font | Size | Weight | Tracking |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Hero | display | `clamp(2.75rem, 6vw, 5rem)` | 600 | -0.02em |
| Section title | display | `clamp(1.75rem, 3vw, 2.75rem)` | 600 | -0.015em |
| Product name | sans | 1–1.125rem | 600 | -0.01em |
| Body | sans | 1rem / 1.65 | 400 | 0 |
| Eyebrow | sans | 0.75rem uppercase | 600 | 0.14em |
| Price / data | sans, tabular-nums | 1rem | 600 | 0 |

### 5.4 Where the gradient is allowed — and where it is banned

A showpiece plus an accent system, never a wallpaper.

**Allowed:** the homepage hero canvas (one per site); primary CTA fills; Blue Tea and Red Tea
collection tiles; 2–4px section-divider rules and the free-shipping progress bar; the Blue Tea PDP
brew-story block; a 6px top edge on the footer.

**Banned:** gradient text below section-title size (never on body copy or prices); gradient behind
product photography; gradient card backgrounds in a grid; more than **one** gradient surface in a
single viewport (hero excepted); any viewport where ivory/white holds less than 60% of the visible
area.

### 5.5 Motion
Micro-interactions 160–220ms `cubic-bezier(.2,.6,.2,1)`. Hero brew morph 900–1400ms. Card hover
lifts 2px and crossfades to the second image. Under `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` everything
collapses to a finished static state — the hero shows its mid-gradient frame and looks complete.

### 5.6 Accessibility — hard floor
WCAG 2.1 AA. White on `--color-citrus` **fails** — never put white text on the lemon stop; use
`--color-ink`. Visible 2px focus rings (`--color-brew-2`, 2px offset) on everything interactive.
Real alt text on every image, sourced from the DB (`product_images.alt`), never auto-filled with the
filename. Full keyboard operability: size selectors, mega-menu, cart drawer, quantity steppers,
admin tables, admin dialogs.

---

## 6. Database schema — the contract

Drizzle, in `lib/db/schema/`, one file per domain. Snake_case columns, `timestamptz`, integer paise.

```
users              id, email(uniq), phone, name, password_hash, role(customer|staff|admin),

reviews            id, product_id, user_id(nullable), order_id(nullable), author_name, email,
                   rating(1-5), title, body, status(pending|approved|rejected),
                   verified_buyer, created_at, moderated_at, moderated_by
review_photos      id, review_id, r2_key, position

audit_log          id, actor_user_id, action, entity, entity_id, diff(jsonb), created_at
```

Indexes are required on: `products.slug`, `products.collection_id`, `products(priority, status)`,
`variants.product_id`, `variants.sku`, `orders.order_number`, `orders(status, placed_at)`,
`orders.user_id`, `order_items.order_id`, `reviews(product_id, status)`, `posts(kind, status,
published_at)`, `wishlist_items.user_id`. Foreign keys with explicit `on delete` behaviour —
never cascade an order or an order item away.

Nothing outside `lib/db/` imports Drizzle. Everything else consumes the domain types in
`types/catalog.ts`, `types/order.ts`.

---

## 7. Commerce rules

### 7.1 Catalogue shape
Seeded from `data/catalog.json`: 20 products, 30 variants, 5 collections. Options are a single axis
per product, labelled by that product's own `option_label` — `Size`, `Combo`, or `Teabags`.

### 7.2 Priority — the client's explicit rule
**Blue Tea first. Then Red Tea. Then everything else.** Stored as `priority` on both `collections`
and `products`: `1` blue-tea, `2` red-tea, `3` classic-teas, `4` combos, `5` spices. Lower sorts
first, everywhere: homepage section order, `/shop` default sort, nav and mega-menu order, footer
collection list, related products, cart upsells. Blue Tea additionally gets the hero, the only
full-bleed editorial band on the homepage, and a brew-story block on its PDP.

`priority` is editable in the admin. The seed data sets it; nothing infers it.

### 7.3 Pricing display
Every variant has an MRP and a live sale price — real discounts of 6–27%. Always render MRP struck
through, sale price prominent, and a `Save X%` chip computed at render time. Never hardcode a
discount. When `price_paise == mrp_paise`, show no strike-through and no chip.

### 7.4 Cart
Client cart in Zustand (variant id + qty), persisted to localStorage inside try/catch, synced to the
`users` row when signed in. Free shipping at **₹500** (from `settings`, not a literal) with a
progress bar showing the exact rupees remaining. Coupon `WELCOME5` — 5% off, first order only — must
exist at launch.

### 7.5 Order integrity — the most important rule in this project
Never trust a price, quantity, discount, or shipping amount that arrives from the client. On every
cart validation and at checkout, the server re-reads each variant from Postgres, recomputes subtotal,
discount, shipping and total in paise, and rejects any mismatch by returning the corrected cart. The
Razorpay order amount is derived from the server total alone. Verify
`HMAC-SHA256(razorpay_order_id|razorpay_payment_id, RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET)` with a timing-safe compare
before marking an order paid, and handle the `payment.captured` webhook idempotently — it may arrive
before, after, or alongside the client callback. Checkout takes an idempotency key so a
double-submit cannot create two orders. Stock decrements and coupon `used_count` increments happen
in the **same transaction** as the order insert.

### 7.6 Stock
The client's data has no counts, only in/out. `stock_qty` is nullable: when null, stock is a boolean
and no quantity is ever shown. Only when a real count exists and is under 10 may the UI say
"Only N left". Never invent scarcity.

---

## 8. Content, imagery and claims

- **Images live in R2**, never in `/public` and never hot-linked from the old site. A migration
  script pulls the existing packshots off `dishumasala.com/wp-content/uploads/`, generates AVIF/WebP
  derivatives with `sharp`, uploads to R2, and records keys, dimensions and alt text in
  `product_images`. This must run before the old site is decommissioned.
- Lifestyle and brew imagery is **AI-generated placeholder** for launch. Every placeholder is
  listed in `PLACEHOLDERS.md` with its slot, aspect ratio and the real photo it stands in for, and
  is referenced only through `components/media/Placeholder.tsx`. No text, no logo, no award badge,
  no certification mark, and no human face presented as a named customer or farmer.
- **Invent nothing.** No fabricated reviews, customer counts, awards, certifications, press
  mentions, or health and medicinal claims. Trust claims ship only with what is verifiable:
  double-layer packaging, free shipping over ₹500, sourced in Punjab, COD available. If the client
  wants more, they supply it in writing.

---

## 9. The admin panel (`/admin`)

Staff-facing, built by us, and the client's daily tool. Same tokens, denser: ivory ground, white
cards, `--color-ink` type, semantic colours for status only, tabular numerals everywhere, no
gradient except a hairline in the sidebar header.

Scope: dashboard (today's orders, revenue, low stock, pending reviews) · orders (filterable table,
detail view, status transitions, Shiprocket dispatch, resend invoice, refund note) · products and
variants (create/edit, drag-to-order images with R2 upload, pricing, stock, priority, SEO fields,
draft/publish) · collections · coupons · reviews moderation queue · customers (with order history) ·
posts and pages (Tiptap) · settings.

**Note (2026-08-26, confirmed with the client stakeholder):** this is a traditional dashboard admin
— sidebar nav, tables, forms — built exactly as scoped above, not an inline WYSIWYG/click-to-edit
page-builder. That pattern was considered and explicitly declined for this project: orders, stock,
coupons and customers are structured operational data, not marketing page content.

Rules: `role` in `staff` or `admin` required, enforced in middleware **and** re-checked in every
server action — never rely on the client hiding a button. Every mutation writes `audit_log` and
calls `revalidateTag`. Destructive actions need typed confirmation and prefer soft-delete
(`archived_at`) over a hard delete; orders and order items are never deletable. Tables are
keyboard-navigable with real pagination and URL-driven filters. Optimistic UI is fine; silent
failure is not.

---

## 10. Deployment

Storefront and admin are one Next.js app on **Vercel**. Postgres on **Neon**, images on **R2**,
mail via **Resend**. Keep `output: "standalone"` on and use no Vercel-only API, so the same build
runs under PM2 behind Nginx on a VPS if the client ever wants to move — document that path in
`docs/DEPLOY.md`.

Env (`.env.example`, every line commented, no `NEXT_PUBLIC_` on any secret):
`DATABASE_URL`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `AUTH_URL`, `R2_ACCOUNT_ID`, `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`,
`R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `R2_BUCKET`, `R2_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_FROM`,
`RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`, `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`, `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `SHIPROCKET_EMAIL`,
`SHIPROCKET_PASSWORD`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`.

### SEO and migration
The old site is ranked, so keep its URL shapes: `/product/<slug>/` and `/collections/<slug>/`, with
the existing product slugs (they are in `catalog.json`). Before launch, crawl the live site for its
full URL list, diff it against the new sitemap, and 301 every gap from a checked-in `redirects.csv`
via `middleware.ts`. **A ranked URL with no destination is a launch blocker** — list gaps
explicitly, never silently point them at the homepage. Ship `next-sitemap`, `robots.txt`,
canonicals, per-page OG images, and JSON-LD for Organization, BreadcrumbList, Product + Offer
(+ AggregateRating only when real reviews exist), FAQPage, Article/Recipe.

---

## 11. Quality gates — every phase must pass before the next

- `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm build`, `pnpm test` clean. No `any`, no `@ts-ignore`, no
  `eslint-disable` without a one-line justification.
- Lighthouse mobile on `/`, `/shop`, a PDP, `/cart`: Performance ≥ 90, Accessibility 100, SEO ≥ 95.
  LCP < 2.0s, CLS < 0.05, INP < 200ms. Homepage first-load JS ≤ 180KB gzip.
- Vitest on: money helpers, cart maths, coupon application, server-side total recomputation, the
  Razorpay signature verifier, and the priority sort.
- Playwright E2E: browse → variant select → add to cart → coupon → checkout → mocked payment →
  order confirmation; plus a COD run; plus a tampered-price run that **must** be rejected.
- Every DB migration applies cleanly to an empty database and the seed runs green after it.
- No secret in the client bundle — grep and report.
- No hardcoded prices, product names, image URLs or copy in components; everything comes from the
  DB layer or `content/`.

---

## 12. Working style for Claude Code

- Work strictly one phase at a time (`PROMPTS.md`). Do not scaffold future phases early.
- Open each phase by restating its acceptance criteria; close it by self-checking against them and
  reporting anything unmet. Never claim completion for something you could not verify.
- Prefer fewer, better files. No barrel-file sprawl, no premature abstraction, no `utils.ts` dump.
- Every server action and route handler: Zod-validated input, typed result, explicit error shape,
  no stack traces to the client.
- Stop and ask when the brief is ambiguous or the data can't support it. Invent no product claims,
  reviews, or numbers.
- Conventional commits, one logical unit each.
