/**
 * Uploads the client-supplied Red Tea section banner (data/banners/Red Tea banner.png) to R2 and
 * saves `settings.red_tea_section_banner` — the banner rendered right after the homepage's Red Tea
 * section. Same "invent nothing" exception as scripts/migrate-homepage-banners.ts (see that file's
 * header and CLAUDE.md §8's 2026-08-28 note): the image carries the client's own marketing text
 * (including health-adjacent phrasing like "Aids Digestion") baked into the pixels, used as-is by
 * explicit client choice.
 *
 * Run with: pnpm migrate-red-tea-banner
