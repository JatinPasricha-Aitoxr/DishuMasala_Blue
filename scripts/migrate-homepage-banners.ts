/**
 * Uploads the client-supplied homepage promotional banners (data/banners/*.png — provided
 * directly by the client, not scraped from the old site) to R2 and saves
 * `settings.homepage_banners`, an ordered list the homepage slider reads.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — deliberate, explicit exception to CLAUDE.md §8 ("invent nothing" / no health
 * claims): these banners carry the client's own marketing text baked directly into the image
 * pixels, including phrasing like "Belly Fat Reduction & Slimming" that would never be allowed in
 * text content this project writes itself. Claude flagged this conflict directly to the client
 * stakeholder before building it; the client explicitly chose to use the banners as-is anyway
 * (2026-08-28 — see the matching note in CLAUDE.md §8). Do not "fix" this by stripping the
 * claims or reverting to a placeholder without checking with the client again.
 *
 * Run with: pnpm migrate-homepage-banners
