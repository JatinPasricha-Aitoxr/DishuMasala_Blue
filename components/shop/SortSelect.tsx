/**
 * A real, independent `<form method="GET">` so a sort change is a genuine URL navigation — carries
 * every other active filter along as hidden fields, so re-sorting never resets a collection/size/
 * price/stock filter (PROMPTS.md Phase 3: "every filter and sort lives in the URL").
 *
 * A NATIVE `<select>`, not Phase 1's Radix-based `components/ui/Select`, is a deliberate choice
 * over the brief's suggestion to reuse that primitive: Radix Select's trigger is a `<button>` that
 * opens a JS-rendered listbox, so with JavaScript disabled it is fully inert — no dropdown, no way
 * to pick a value at all. A native `<select>` is keyboard-accessible for free (the acceptance
 * criterion that actually matters here) AND still works with zero JS (arrow keys / typing to
 * choose, then the surrounding form's real submit). When JS *is* available, `onChange` submits
 * the form immediately (`requestSubmit()`) instead of waiting for a separate click — the same GET
 * navigation either way, just faster.
