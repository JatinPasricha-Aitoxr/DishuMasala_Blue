# Placeholder imagery

Every AI-generated placeholder image this project uses before real photography exists
(CLAUDE.md §8) is listed here and defined in one place: `content/placeholders.ts`. It is rendered
**only** through `components/media/Placeholder.tsx` — no page or component references an image
path for one of these slots directly.

Right now (Phase 1), no image-generation step exists yet, so every slot renders as a flat,
token-colored rectangle or the brand's cool gradient (`--gradient-brew-cool`) — never actual
AI-generated imagery. Every placeholder carries **no text, no logo, no badge, no certification
mark, and no human face presented as a named person**, per CLAUDE.md §8.

Swapping in real photography later is a one-file change: replace the relevant call site
(`<Placeholder slot="..." />`) with the real `next/image` render once that slot's real photo
exists, or — for `product-packshot-generic` specifically — once the product actually has a
`product_images` row from the R2 migration script (`scripts/migrate-images.ts`), which is a
*separate* system from this one (see below).

## Placeholder imagery vs. real product photography

These are two different pipelines and should not be confused:

- **Real product packshots** (the 20 seeded products' actual photos) come from
  `dishumasala.com/wp-content/uploads/` via `scripts/migrate-images.ts`, get AVIF/WebP
  derivatives via `sharp`, and are stored in R2 and recorded in the `product_images` table
  (CLAUDE.md §8). This is real photography, not a placeholder, and is out of scope for this
  manifest once it exists for a given product.
- **AI-generated placeholder imagery** (this manifest) stands in for lifestyle and brew shots
  that don't exist as photography at all yet — hero, brew-story, sourcing, blog covers — and,
  until the migration above has run for a given product, also stands in for that product's
  packshot so `ProductCard` and friends have something reservable to lay out around.

## Manifest

| Slot key | Aspect ratio | Interim visual | Stands in for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `product-packshot-generic` | 1 / 1 | Flat (`--color-surface-2`) | A real product packshot on white/ivory background, migrated from the old site and served from R2. Used only when a product has no `product_images` row yet. |
| `blue-tea-band-editorial` | 21 / 9 | Flat (`--color-surface-2`) | The homepage's full-bleed Blue Tea band: butterfly pea tea mid-pour, caught mid colour-change from blue to violet as lemon hits the cup. Flat tone (not the brew-cool gradient) because the band's own section background already carries that gradient. |
| `pdp-brew-story-blue-tea` | 4 / 3 | `--gradient-brew-cool` | The Blue Tea PDP's brew-story sequence — three or four close-up frames of the same cup shifting from blue to magenta, no identifiable hands or faces. |
| `lifestyle-sourced-punjab` | 4 / 5 | Flat warm (`--color-line`) | A Punjab sourcing/farm lifestyle shot supporting the "sourced in Punjab" trust claim — fields or raw spice, no named farmer, no certification mark overlaid. |
| `red-tea-lifestyle` | 4 / 5 | Flat warm (`--color-line`) | The homepage Red Tea section's supporting image — hibiscus tea mid-pour or dried hibiscus/rose petals, ruby-red. |
| `ritual-lemon-brew` | 4 / 5 | Flat (`--color-surface-2`) | The homepage ritual/recipe teaser — a lemon wedge about to meet a cup of Blue Tea, just before the colour shift. |
| `blog-cover-generic` | 16 / 9 | Flat warm (`--color-line`) | A blog/recipe post cover image (`posts.cover_r2_key`) before a real photo or illustration is commissioned for that specific post. |

To add a new slot: add an entry to `PLACEHOLDER_MANIFEST` in `content/placeholders.ts` (aspect
ratio, `standsInFor` description, interim `tone`), then render it with
`<Placeholder slot="your-new-slot" />`. Do not add an `<img>`/`next/image` call for
not-yet-real imagery anywhere else in the codebase — always go through this manifest.
